# Liz Lerman Critical Response Process

Liz Lerman's Critical Response Process is a widely used method for responding to artists' work 

The Process engages participants in **three roles**:

The **presenter **offers a work-in-progress for review and feels prepared to question that work in a dialogue with other people;

**Responders**, committed to the presenter’s intent to make excellent work, offer reactions to the work in a dialogue with the presenter; and

The **facilitator** initiates each step, keeps the process on track, and works to help the presenter and responders use the Process to frame useful questions and responses.


The Critical Response Process takes place after a presentation of a work. Work can be short or long, large or small, and at any stage in its development. The facilitator then leads the presenter and responders through four steps:

1. **Statements of Meaning**: Responders state what was meaningful, evocative, interesting, exciting, striking in the work they have just witnessed.
2. **Presenter as Questioner**: The presenter asks questions about the work. After each question, the responders answer. Responders may express opinions if they are in direct response to the question asked and do not contain suggestions for changes.
3. **Neutral Questions**: Responders ask neutral questions about the work. The artist responds. Questions are neutral when they do not have an opinion couched in them. For example, if you are discussing the lighting of a scene, “Why was it so dark?” is not a neutral question. “What ideas guided your choices about lighting?” is.
4. **Opinion Time**: Responders state opinions, subject to permission from the presenter. The usual form is “I have an opinion about ______, would you like to hear it?” The presenter has the option to decline opinions for any reason.
