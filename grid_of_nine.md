# Grid of Nine

This four-step assignment helps your focus the thinking and research to begin your project.

**Develop three completely different sets of questions, issues or domains you are interested in investigating. For each, write a distinct concept.**

Here are a few examples:
I am interested in how game technologies can be used to expand storytelling.
I am interested in how young women can be encouraged to pursue STEM-related careers.
I am interested in how algorithmic generation can be harnessed to artistic ends.

Next, develop those interests into thesis concepts that involve both an area of investigation and a project:

“I would like to research five of the most promising examples of experimental storytelling. For the three I am most interested in, I will diagram the relationship between the narrative, the interaction model, the technology and the visual and aural aesthetics.”

“I would like to research the current state of STEM education as it relates to young women in order to identify the five key problems keeping young women from pursuing engineering careers. I will develop a list of potential solutions for the three problems I am most interested in and capable of addressing.”

“I would like to research five of the most exciting examples of algorithmic art. I will pick my three favorites, and conceptualize a project of my own using the same algorithms.”


**For each concept, think of three different forms of media / methods you would consider utilizing to realize that concept in slightly different ways.**  You should end up with a grid of 9: three concepts, each realized three different ways. For example, using  the color perception across cultures inquiry:
An illustrated children’s book that tells the story of a young woman traveling around the world to collect the primary colors.
A game in which players connect colors and feelings  to objects from around the world.
An interactive information visualization that uses a splayed map of the world as its interface.
 

**For each of the 9 cells, list pros and cons, and rate your relative level of excitement for each.**
